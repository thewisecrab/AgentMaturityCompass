# 🧭 Agent Maturity Compass (AMC)

**The credit score for AI agents.**

```
🧭 AMC Score: 3.7 / 5.0 — Defined
   Strategic Operations ···· 3.2  (22 questions)
   Reliability & Safety ···· 4.1  (24 questions)
   Security & Compliance ··· 3.8  (23 questions)
   Observability & Cost ···· 3.5  (21 questions)
   Evaluation & Growth ····· 3.9  (21 questions)
   Evidence: ✓ Merkle root 9c4e…a7f0 (Ed25519)
```

## The 84-Point Lie

Every AI governance framework has the same fatal flaw: **the agent being evaluated provides the evidence.**

| Scoring Method | Score | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| Keyword / self-reported | 100/100 ✅ | "I have safety controls" |
| AMC execution-verified | 16/100 ❌ | Agent bypassed every control when tested |

That's an **84-point documentation inflation gap**. AMC closes it with cryptographic evidence chains that can't be faked.

## Get Started (2 minutes)

```bash
npm i -g agent-maturity-compass
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
amc init
```

That's it. `amc init` walks you through your first score interactively.

## How It Works

```
Agent (untrusted) → AMC Gateway (trusted observer) → Evidence Ledger (signed, hash-chained)
                                                              ↓
                                                Scoring Engine (113 questions, 5 dimensions)
                                                              ↓
                                               AMC Studio (dashboard + API)
```

Not all evidence is equal — AMC weights by trust tier:

| Tier | Weight | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| OBSERVED_HARDENED | 1.1× | AMC-controlled traces with stronger context |
| OBSERVED | 1.0× | Directly observed via AMC gateway |
| ATTESTED | 0.8× | Cryptographic attestation via vault/notary |
| SELF_REPORTED | 0.4× | Agent claims — capped, cannot inflate maturity |

## Works With Any Agent

```bash
amc wrap claude -- claude "analyze this"           # Claude
amc wrap gemini -- gemini chat                     # Gemini
amc adapters run --adapter generic-cli -- python bot.py  # Any CLI agent
amc score evidence-ingest --format openai-evals    # Import existing evals
```

12+ framework adapters: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, Claude Code, Gemini, OpenClaw, and more.

| Dimension | Questions | Focus |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Strategic Operations | 22 | Mission clarity, scope adherence, decision traceability |
| Reliability & Safety | 24 | Graceful degradation, circuit breakers, kill switches |
| Security & Compliance | 23 | Injection defense, DLP, zero-trust, regulatory alignment |
| Observability & Cost | 21 | Structured logs, traces, cost tracking, SLO monitoring |

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| L0 | Absent | No structure. Reactive. Fragile. |
| L1 | Initial | Intent exists but isn't operational. |
| L2 | Developing | Partial structure. Edge cases break. |
| L3 | Defined | Repeatable. Measurable. Auditable. |
| L4 | Managed | Proactive. Risk-calibrated. Stress-tested. |
| L5 | Optimizing | Self-correcting. Certified. Continuously verified. |

<summary><strong>🔴 Assurance Lab (Built-in Red Team)</strong></summary>

AMC doesn't just score — it attacks. 66 deterministic attack packs including:

- **injection** — Prompt override and system-message tampering
- **exfiltration** — Secret and PII leakage controls
- **toolMisuse** — Denied tools, model, and budget boundaries
- **truthfulness** — Evidence-bound claim discipline
- **sycophancy** — Does the agent agree with wrong statements to please you?
- **self-preservation** — Does the agent resist shutdown or modification?
- **sabotage** — Does the agent subtly undermine goals when conflicted?
- **adversarial-robustness** — TAP/PAIR, Crescendo, Skeleton Key attacks
- **context-leakage** — EchoLeak, cross-session data bleed
- **operational-discipline** — Supply chain integrity, MCP poisoning

```bash
amc assurance run --scope full --agent my-agent
```

<summary><strong>🔬 69 Scoring Modules</strong></summary>

Beyond the core diagnostic, AMC includes research-backed scoring:

- Calibration gap (confidence vs reality)
- Evidence conflict detection
- Evidence density mapping (blind spot detection)
- Gaming resistance (adversarial score inflation)
- Sleeper agent detection (context-dependent behavior)
- Audit depth (black-box, white-box, outside-the-box)
- Policy consistency (pass^k reliability)
- Task horizon (METR-inspired)
- Factuality (parametric, retrieval, grounded)
- Autonomy duration with domain risk profiles
- Pause quality (agent-initiated stops)
- Memory integrity & poisoning resistance
- Alignment index (safety × honesty × helpfulness)
- Interpretability scoring
- Output attestation (cryptographic signing)
- Mutual verification (agent-to-agent trust)
- Network transparency log (Merkle tree)
- EU AI Act compliance, OWASP LLM Top 10
- And more...
