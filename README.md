## The 84-Point Lie

Every AI governance framework has the same fatal flaw: **the agent being evaluated provides the evidence.**

| Scoring Method | Score | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| Keyword / self-reported | 100/100 ✅ | "I have safety controls" |
| AMC execution-verified | 16/100 ❌ | Agent bypassed every control when tested |

That's an **84-point documentation inflation gap**. AMC closes it with cryptographic evidence chains that can't be faked.

## Get Started (2 minutes)

```bash
npm i -g agent-maturity-compass
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
amc init
```

That's it. `amc init` walks you through your first score interactively.

**Share your score** — paste a badge into your README:

## How It Works

```
Agent (untrusted) → AMC Gateway (trusted observer) → Evidence Ledger (signed, hash-chained)
                                                              ↓
                                                Scoring Engine (138 questions, 5 dimensions)
                                                              ↓
                                               AMC Studio (dashboard + API)
```

Not all evidence is equal — AMC weights by trust tier:

| Tier | Weight | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| OBSERVED_HARDENED | 1.1× | AMC-controlled traces with stronger context |
| OBSERVED | 1.0× | Directly observed via AMC gateway |
| ATTESTED | 0.8× | Cryptographic attestation via vault/notary |
| SELF_REPORTED | 0.4× | Agent claims — capped, cannot inflate maturity |

## Works With Any Agent

```bash
amc wrap claude -- claude "analyze this"           # Claude
amc wrap gemini -- gemini chat                     # Gemini
amc adapters run --adapter generic-cli -- python bot.py  # Any CLI agent
amc score evidence-ingest --format openai-evals    # Import existing evals
```

14 framework adapters: LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, Claude Code, Gemini, OpenClaw, OpenHands, and more.

## Agent Guide — Guardrails From Your Score

AMC doesn't just score — it generates operational guardrails and applies them directly to your agent's config file.

```bash
# One command: detect framework → generate guardrails → apply to config
amc guide --go
```

- **10 frameworks** auto-detected from project files (pyproject.toml, package.json, config files)
- **15 config targets** — AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .kiro/steering, .gemini/style.md, and more
- **Severity-tagged** — 🔴 Critical, 🟡 High, 🔵 Medium — so you know what to fix first
- **Idempotent** — re-running `--apply` updates only the guardrails section (AMC-GUARDRAILS markers)
- **CI gate** — `amc guide --ci --target 3` exits non-zero if below threshold
- **Compliance** — `amc guide --compliance EU_AI_ACT` maps gaps to regulatory obligations (EU AI Act, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, SOC 2, ISO 27001)

```bash
amc guide --status              # One-line health check
amc guide --interactive         # Cherry-pick which gaps to fix
amc guide --watch --apply       # Continuous monitoring + auto-update
amc guide --diff                # What improved since last run
```

## Sector Packs — Enterprise-Grade Vertical Assessment

AMC ships with **40 industry-specific assessment packs** covering regulated sectors, critical infrastructure, and public institutions. Each pack adds precise, sub-vertical questions on top of the base AMC rubric.

```bash
amc sector packs list              # 40 packs across 7 stations
amc sector score --pack digital-health-record --agent my-agent
amc sector gaps --pack clinical-trials --agent my-agent
amc sector report --pack drug-discovery --output reports/drug.md
```

| Station | Packs | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 🌿 Environment | 6 | Farm-to-fork, textiles, manufacturing, energy, water |
| 🏥 Health | 9 | EHR, clinical trials, drug discovery, precision medicine |
| 💰 Wealth | 5 | Payments, financial inclusion, DeFi, circular economy |
| 🎓 Education | 5 | K-12, higher ed, skills training, accessibility |
| 🚇 Mobility | 5 | Smart cities, ports, real estate, cloud infra, privacy |
| 💡 Technology | 5 | AI intelligence, ecosystems, infotainment, IP partnerships |
| 🏛️ Governance | 5 | Digital identity, elections, legislation, citizen services |

**382 questions** with specific regulatory article references (`HIPAA §164.312(a)(1)`, `EU AI Act Art. 5(1)(a)`, `FERPA 20 U.S.C. §1232g`, `UNECE WP.29 R155 §7`, `UNCAC Art. 7`). Every pack includes `riskTier`, EU AI Act classification, SDG alignment, certification path, and key risks.
