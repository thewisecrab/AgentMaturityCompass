## 🟢 Simple Version — What Is This?

**AI agents can do amazing things.** They write code, manage your calendar, send emails, handle customer support, make financial decisions. But here's the problem:

**How do you know if an AI agent is actually safe and trustworthy?**

Today, agents grade themselves. That's like letting students grade their own exams. AMC fixes this.

### What AMC Does (in plain English)

1. **Watches** your AI agent work (without the agent knowing)
2. **Tests** it with real scenarios — including trick questions and edge cases
3. **Scores** it on a simple scale from L0 (dangerous) to L5 (trustworthy)
4. **Proves** the score with cryptographic evidence that can't be faked

### The Problem AMC Solves

| How Agents Are Evaluated Today | How AMC Evaluates |
|---|---|
| Agent says "I'm safe" → Score: 100 ✅ | AMC secretly tests agent → Real score: 16 ❌ |
| Self-reported documentation | Execution-verified evidence |
| Trust me, bro | Trust, but verify with math |

That's an **84-point gap** between what agents claim and what they actually do.

### Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
# Install
npm i -g agent-maturity-compass

# Create a project and get your first score
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
export AMC_VAULT_PASSPHRASE='pick-a-passphrase'   # needed for cryptographic evidence chain
amc init
```

That's it. `amc init` walks you through everything interactively. The passphrase protects your agent's cryptographic evidence vault — pick something memorable.

### What You Get

- **A trust score** from L0 to L5 with a clear breakdown
- **A gap analysis** showing exactly what to fix and how
- **Auto-generated guardrails** that plug directly into your agent's config
- **Auto-remediation** — generates config files, CI gates, governance docs
- **A badge** for your README showing your agent's trust level
- **HTML reports** for stakeholders (print to PDF)

```bash
amc quickscore --share       # Get your score + action plan
amc evidence collect         # Guided wizard to connect your agent
amc guide --go               # Auto-apply guardrails to your config
amc fix                      # Generate remediation files (guardrails, CI gate, governance)
amc report <id> --html r.html  # Styled report → print to PDF
amc badge                    # ![AMC L3](https://img.shields.io/badge/AMC-L3-blue)
```

## 🔵 Technical Version — How It Works

### Architecture

```
Agent (untrusted) → AMC Gateway (transparent MITM proxy) → Evidence Ledger (Ed25519 + Merkle tree)
                                                                    ↓
                                                      Scoring Engine (140 core questions, 5 dimensions)
                                                                    ↓
                                                       AMC Studio (dashboard + API + CLI)
```

The gateway sits between your agent and the LLM provider. It captures every API call and tool use with Ed25519 signatures. The agent doesn't know it's being watched.

### Evidence Trust Tiers

Not all evidence is equal:

| Tier | Weight | How It's Collected |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| `OBSERVED_HARDENED` | 1.1× | AMC-controlled adversarial test scenarios |
| `OBSERVED` | 1.0× | Directly captured via AMC gateway proxy |
| `ATTESTED` | 0.8× | Cryptographic attestation via vault/notary |
| `SELF_REPORTED` | 0.4× | Agent's own claims — capped, can't inflate score |

### 5 Dimensions, 140 Core Questions

| Dimension | Questions | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Strategic Agent Ops | 18 | Mission clarity, scope adherence, decision traceability |
| Skills | 38 | Tool mastery, injection defense, DLP, least-privilege execution |
| Resilience | 30 | Graceful degradation, circuit breakers, monitor bypass resistance |
| Leadership & Autonomy | 28 | Structured logs, traces, cost tracking, SLO monitoring |
| Culture & Alignment | 26 | Test harnesses, benchmarks, feedback loops, over-compliance detection |

### Maturity Scale (L0 → L5)

| Level | Name | What It Means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **L0** | Absent | No safety controls. No logging. No oversight. |
| **L1** | Initial | Some intent to be safe, but nothing operational yet. |
| **L2** | Developing | Partial structure. Works in happy path, breaks at edges. |
| **L3** | Defined | Repeatable. Measurable. Auditable. EU AI Act minimum. |
| **L4** | Managed | Proactive. Risk-calibrated. Cryptographic proof chains. |
| **L5** | Optimizing | Self-correcting. Continuously verified. Fully certified. |

### Works With Any Agent Framework

```bash
# Wrap any CLI agent
amc wrap claude -- claude "analyze this"
amc wrap gemini -- gemini chat
amc adapters run --adapter generic-cli -- python bot.py

# Import existing evaluations
amc score evidence-ingest --format openai-evals
```

**14 built-in adapters:** LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, Claude Code, Gemini, OpenClaw, OpenHands, Python AMC SDK, Generic CLI, OpenAI-Compatible API.

Zero code changes. One environment variable.
