# Getting Started with AMC

**Time to first score: ~2 minutes.**

AMC (Agent Maturity Compass) scores your AI agent's trustworthiness from actual behavior — not self-reported claims. Think of it as a credit score for AI agents.

---

## Install

```bash
npm i -g agent-maturity-compass
```

## Your First Score (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Create a workspace
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
amc init

# 2. Get your first maturity score (interactive, 5 questions)
amc quickscore
```

That's it. You now have a baseline maturity level (L0–L5).

---

## Understanding Your Score

AMC scores agents on a 5-level scale:

| Level | What it means | Think of it as... |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| L0 | No governance | Running with scissors |
| L1 | Ad-hoc controls | Sticky notes on the monitor |
| L2 | Repeatable processes | Checklists exist |
| L3 | Defined & measured | Dashboards and alerts |
| L4 | Managed & optimized | Continuous improvement |
| L5 | Self-governing | Autopilot with proof |

## What Gets Scored

AMC evaluates 5 dimensions, each with specific questions:

1. **Purpose & Boundaries** — Does the agent know what it should and shouldn't do?
2. **Autonomy & Oversight** — How much freedom does it have, and who's watching?
3. **Trustworthiness** — Is it honest, safe, and consistent?
4. **Operational Maturity** — Can it handle failures, scale, and recover?
5. **Ecosystem & Compliance** — Does it play well with others and follow the rules?

## Improving Your Agent's Score

### Check what needs work

```bash
# Full diagnostic — shows every dimension and where you're weak
amc score formal-spec my-agent

# Quick check — what's your biggest gap?
amc quickscore
```

### Common improvements by level

**L0 → L1** (the basics):
```bash
# Define what your agent is allowed to do
amc score behavioral-contract    # Shows if you have an alignment card

# Check if you have basic safety controls
amc score owasp-llm              # OWASP LLM Top 10 coverage
```

**L1 → L2** (add structure):
```bash
# Set up evidence collection
amc score collect-evidence my-agent

# Check your audit trail
amc score audit-depth

# Verify policy enforcement
amc score policy-consistency
```

**L2 → L3** (measure everything):
```bash
# Score factuality and truthfulness
amc score factuality

# Check alignment across safety, honesty, helpfulness
amc score alignment-index

# Monitor behavioral drift
amc score sleeper-detection
```

**L3 → L4** (optimize):
```bash
# Calibration — does the agent know what it doesn't know?
amc score calibration-gap

# Evidence density — are there blind spots?
amc score density-map

# Gaming resistance — can someone cheat the scores?
amc score gaming-resistance
```

**L4 → L5** (prove it):
```bash
# Cryptographic evidence chains
amc score output-attestation

# Agent-to-agent trust verification
amc score mutual-verification

# Transparency log with Merkle proofs
amc score transparency-log
```

---

## Studio (Local Control Plane)

Studio is AMC's local web UI for managing agents, viewing scores, and running evaluations.

```bash
# Start Studio
amc up

# Check status
amc status

# Stop Studio
amc down
```

Studio gives you:
- Live dashboard with agent scores
- Evidence browser
- Evaluation runner
- Policy editor
- Audit log viewer

---

## Connecting Your Agent Framework

AMC auto-detects your framework during setup:

```bash
amc setup --demo    # Quick start with demo data
amc setup           # Full setup with framework detection
```

Supported frameworks (auto-detected):
- **LangChain** (Python & Node)
- **LangGraph**
- **CrewAI**
- **AutoGen**
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**
- **LlamaIndex**
- **Semantic Kernel**
- **Claude Code**
- **Gemini CLI**
- **OpenClaw**
- **OpenHands**
- **Generic CLI** (any agent via shell wrapper)

### Manual adapter setup

```bash
# List available adapters
amc adapters list

# Run an evaluation with a specific adapter
amc adapters run langchain-python --agent my-agent
```

---

## Evidence Collection

AMC's power comes from evidence — not questionnaires. Evidence is collected automatically during agent runs.

```bash
# Collect evidence from a run
amc score collect-evidence my-agent

# Verify evidence integrity
amc evidence verify

# Bundle evidence for sharing
amc evidence bundle create
```

### Ingesting from external eval systems

Already running evals elsewhere? Import them:

```bash
# From OpenAI Evals
amc score evidence-ingest --format openai-evals

# From LangSmith
amc score evidence-ingest --format langsmith

# From MLflow
amc score evidence-ingest --format mlflow

# From Weights & Biases
amc score evidence-ingest --format weights-biases
```

amc score --help        # All scoring commands
amc evidence --help     # Evidence management
amc audit --help        # Audit tools

```

---

## JSON Output

Every command supports `--json` for automation:

```bash
amc quickscore --json
amc score calibration-gap --json
amc doctor --json
```

Pipe into `jq` for scripting:

```bash
amc score formal-spec my-agent --json | jq '.overallScore'
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Doctor result: FAIL"
This is normal on first run. The doctor checks for optional components:
- **Studio not running** → Run `amc up`
- **Vault locked** → Run `amc vault unlock`
- **Gateway config missing** → Run `amc gateway init`
- **Signature issues** → Run `amc doctor-fix`

### "Score is 0"
Zero scores mean no data was provided. AMC scores from evidence, not defaults:
1. Run `amc score collect-evidence <agentId>` to gather data
2. Or use `--json` to pipe in evidence programmatically
3. Or run `amc quickscore` for a questionnaire-based baseline

### Python tests
```bash
# From repo root
python3 -m pytest platform/python/tests/ -q

# From platform directory
cd platform/python && python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```
