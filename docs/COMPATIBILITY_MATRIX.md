# AMC Compatibility Matrix

A practical compatibility guide for teams deciding whether AMC will work with their stack.

## What this document covers

This matrix focuses on real adoption questions:

- Can AMC wrap my agent without code changes?
- Can AMC capture evidence from my framework?
- Can AMC run scoring, assurance, trace inspection, and reporting?
- What level of support should I expect right now?

## Summary

| Category | Status |
|---|---|
| CLI-based agent wrapping | Strong |
| Node/Python framework support | Strong |
| OpenAI-compatible endpoint scoring | Strong |
| Full trust scoring + assurance flows | Strong |
| Non-agent LLM app scoring (`lite-score`) | Strong |
| Browser playground / no-install trial | Available |
| Enterprise deployment options | Available |
| Public hosted sandbox for real agent execution | Not yet first-class |

## Workflow compatibility

| Workflow | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quick trust score | ✅ | `amc quickscore` |
| Deep diagnostic | ✅ | Full question bank and scoring modules |
| Active red-teaming | ✅ | Assurance packs |
| Compliance reporting | ✅ | Audit binders, domain packs, framework reports |

---

## Environment compatibility

| Environment | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | ✅ | Strong |
| Linux | ✅ | Strong |
| Windows | ⚠️ | Usable, but some shell-centric flows may be smoother via WSL/container |
| Docker | ✅ | Supported |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ | Supported |
| Local developer workstation | ✅ | Excellent fit |
| CI/CD pipeline | ✅ | Good fit |
| Air-gapped / offline verification | ✅ | Bundle/cert verification model supports this |

## Recommended adoption paths

### If you already run an agent framework
Use:
- `amc wrap <adapter> -- ...`
- `amc quickscore`
- `amc assurance run --scope full`
- `amc trace inspect`
- `amc observe timeline`

### If you only have a chatbot or LLM app
Use:
- `amc lite-score`
- `amc dataset create`
- `amc dataset run`
- `amc eval import`

### If you are a security/compliance team
Use:
- `amc assurance run`
- `amc compliance report`
- `amc audit binder create`
- `amc business report`

---

## Known friction points

- Some frameworks are better supported through CLI wrapping than native SDK semantics.
- Windows users may prefer Docker or WSL for the smoothest experience.
- OpenHands is not as mature as the mainline adapter set.
- Hosted browser sandbox for real execution is still more roadmap than polished product.

---

## Bottom line

AMC already works best for teams that want to:

- wrap an existing agent without rewriting it,
- score trust maturity from execution evidence,
- run red-team and compliance workflows,
- and build repeatable evaluation loops over time.

If your system can run from a CLI, a Node/Python stack, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, AMC is already in very workable territory.
