# Diagnostic Bank (5 Dimensions, 89 Questions)

AMC diagnostic bank is a signed, explicit rubric built from the live question bank in `src/diagnostic/questionBank.ts`.

Files:
- `.amc/diagnostic/bank/bank.yaml`
- `.amc/diagnostic/bank/bank.yaml.sig`

Commands:

```bash
amc diagnostic bank init
amc diagnostic bank verify
amc diagnostic render --agent default --format md
```

Hard guarantees:
- exactly 5 dimensions
- exactly 89 questions
- each question has 6 rubric levels (`0..5`)
- each question has explicit evidence mapping and minimum coverage logic

Scoring model:
- agents cannot submit scores or override answers
- scores are derived from OBSERVED/ATTESTED evidence gates
- missing evidence yields `UNKNOWN` and applies conservative score caps
- SELF_REPORTED telemetry cannot increase high-trust maturity tiers

Contextualization:
- question semantics remain fixed
- phrasing/examples are adapted by agent profile (`code-agent` / `support-agent` / `ops-agent` / `research-agent` / `sales-agent` / `other`)
