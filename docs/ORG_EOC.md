# Org Education → Ownership → Commitment (E/O/C)

AMC extends E/O/C from single-agent planning to node-level (team/function/process/enterprise).

Generated artifacts:
- `/Users/thewisecrab/AMC/.amc/org/commitments/<nodeId>/<commitId>.md`
- `/Users/thewisecrab/AMC/.amc/org/commitments/<nodeId>/<commitId>.md.sig`

Each artifact is signed and appended to transparency.

amc org learn --node team-platform --out .amc/reports/team-platform-education.md
