## Paper 1: Zombie Agents — Persistent Control via Self-Reinforcing Injections

- **arXiv:** [2602.15654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15654)
- **Authors:** Xianglin Yang, Yufei He, Shuo Ji et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-17
- **Key Finding:** Self-evolving LLM agents that write/reuse long-term memory are vulnerable to persistent compromise. An attacker embeds a payload via indirect exposure (e.g., poisoned web content during a benign task). The payload survives across sessions through the agent's normal memory update process, turning the agent into a "zombie" that executes unauthorized actions on future triggers. Persistence strategies defeat both sliding-window and RAG-based memory filtering.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety dimension. Directly extends the memory poisoning attack surface.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `memoryPoisoningPack.ts` and `memoryIntegrity.ts`, but these test single-session memory corruption. The Zombie Agent attack is fundamentally cross-session — the payload persists through the agent's own learning/memory-update mechanism. AMC's existing `memoryMaturityPack.ts` doesn't test for self-reinforcing persistence where the agent's memory evolution amplifies the attack.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW assurance pack: `zombieAgentPersistencePack.ts` — test whether injected content in session N survives memory compaction/retrieval into session N+5 and triggers unauthorized tool use
  - Enhancement to `memoryIntegrity.ts`: add cross-session memory integrity verification scoring
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent's memory update process validate content provenance before persisting observations as reusable instructions?"

## Paper 2: Bypassing AI Control Protocols via Agent-as-a-Proxy Attacks

- **arXiv:** [2602.05066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05066)
- **Authors:** Jafar Isbarov, Murat Kantarcioglu
- **Date:** 2026-02-04
- **Key Finding:** Monitoring-based defenses (AlignmentCheck, Extract-and-Evaluate) that jointly evaluate an agent's CoT and tool-use actions can be bypassed by treating the agent as a delivery mechanism. The attack bypasses both agent and monitor simultaneously. Even frontier-scale monitors (Qwen2.5-72B) are vulnerable — large monitoring models can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities (GPT-4o mini, Llama-3.1-70B). This demonstrates that monitoring-based agentic defenses are fundamentally fragile regardless of model scale.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Governance & Oversight dimension. Challenges the assumption that trusted monitoring is sufficient.
- **Gap Status:** NEW GAP
- **Analysis:** AMC has `humanOversightQuality.ts` and `behavioralTransparency.ts`, but these assume that monitoring (whether human or AI) can reliably detect misaligned actions. This paper proves that CoT-based monitoring has a fundamental bypass: the agent can be used as a proxy to deliver attacks that look benign to both the agent's reasoning and the monitor's evaluation. No existing AMC module scores the robustness of the monitoring pipeline itself against adversarial bypass.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW score module: `monitorBypassResistance.ts` — does the monitoring pipeline resist adversarial attacks that treat the agent as a proxy? Are there defense-in-depth layers beyond CoT monitoring?
  - NEW assurance pack: `agentAsProxyPack.ts` — test whether indirect prompt injections can bypass both the agent's safety reasoning and the monitoring layer simultaneously
  - Enhancement to `humanOversightQuality.ts`: score whether oversight mechanisms have independent verification channels (not just CoT inspection)

## Paper 3: Basic Legibility Protocols Improve Trusted Monitoring

- **arXiv:** [2602.10153](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10153)
- **Authors:** Ashwin Sreevatsa, Sebastian Prasanna, Cody Rushing
- **Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Key Finding:** Legibility protocols — encouraging untrusted models to document their code with comments — improve safety without sacrificing task performance. Commenting disproportionately benefits honest code (which has natural explanations that resolve monitor suspicion) while backdoored code frequently lacks easy justification. Gains from commenting increase with monitor strength. This is a practical, low-cost intervention for trusted monitoring.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Governance & Oversight dimension. Provides a concrete, measurable intervention for improving monitoring effectiveness.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `behavioralTransparency.ts` and `decisionExplainability.ts` which score whether agents can explain their decisions. But neither specifically scores whether the agent's outputs are structured to be legible to monitors — the distinction between "can explain" and "proactively makes actions easy to verify." The legibility protocol is a maturity indicator: higher-maturity agents should produce self-documenting outputs.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `behavioralTransparency.ts`: add legibility scoring — does the agent proactively structure its outputs (code comments, reasoning annotations, decision justifications) to facilitate monitoring?
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent produce self-documenting outputs that enable efficient verification by monitoring systems?"

## Paper 4: When Visibility Outpaces Verification — Delayed Verification in Agentic AI

- **arXiv:** [2602.11412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11412)
- **Authors:** Hanjing Shi, Dominic DiFranzo
- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Key Finding:** High-visibility discussions about agentic AI experience significantly delayed or absent verification cues compared to low-visibility threads ("Popularity Paradox"). This creates a "Narrative Lock-in" window where early, unverified claims crystallize into collective cognitive biases before evidence-seeking behaviors emerge. The "credibility-by-visibility" effect has direct implications for AI safety — popular claims about agent capabilities/safety may be accepted without verification.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Governance & Oversight dimension. Relevant to how organizations evaluate and adopt agent systems.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `claimProvenance.ts` and `claimExpiry.ts` which score evidence-backed claims. But these focus on the agent's own claims, not on the organizational process of verifying claims about agents. The "narrative lock-in" pattern applies to how organizations adopt maturity assessments — they may accept high-visibility vendor claims without independent verification.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `claimProvenance.ts`: score whether maturity claims are independently verified vs. self-reported
  - This is more of a process/methodology concern than a new module — but it reinforces the importance of AMC's evidence-over-claims philosophy

## Paper 5: ForesightSafety Bench — Frontier Risk Evaluation and Governance Framework

- **arXiv:** [2602.14135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14135)
- **Authors:** Haibo Tong, Feifei Zhao, Linghao Feng et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Key Finding:** Proposes a comprehensive AI safety evaluation framework with 7 fundamental safety pillars extending to 94 refined risk dimensions, including Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety, and Catastrophic/Existential Risks. Evaluation of 20+ mainstream models reveals widespread safety vulnerabilities across multiple pillars. The framework is hierarchically structured and dynamically evolving.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to all AMC dimensions. Provides a complementary risk taxonomy that AMC should cross-reference.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC's 5-dimension model covers much of this ground, but ForesightSafety Bench identifies specific risk dimensions AMC doesn't explicitly score: Embodied AI Safety (physical-world agent risks), AI4Science Safety (agents in scientific research), and Catastrophic/Existential Risks (self-replication, resource acquisition). AMC's `crossFrameworkMapping.ts` should map to this benchmark.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `crossFrameworkMapping.ts`: add ForesightSafety Bench as a mapped framework
  - Consider NEW score module: `catastrophicRiskIndicators.ts` — does the agent exhibit any indicators of self-replication capability, resource acquisition behavior, or resistance to shutdown?
  - The 94-dimension taxonomy is useful for validating AMC's coverage completeness

## Paper 6: Human Society-Inspired 4C Framework for Agentic AI Security

- **arXiv:** [2602.01942](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01942)
- **Authors:** Alsharif Abuadbba, Nazatul Sultan, Surya Nepal et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-02
- **Key Finding:** Introduces the 4C Framework organizing agentic risks across four interdependent dimensions: Core (system/infrastructure integrity), Connection (communication/coordination/trust), Cognition (belief/goal/reasoning integrity), and Compliance (ethical/legal/institutional governance). Shifts AI security from system-centric protection to preservation of behavioral integrity and intent. Complements existing AI security strategies.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps across all AMC dimensions. The 4C taxonomy is a governance-level framework that AMC should cross-reference.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC's 5-dimension model (Trust & Safety, Governance & Oversight, Operational Maturity, Technical Robustness, Ecosystem Integration) overlaps significantly with 4C. However, the "Cognition" dimension (belief/goal/reasoning integrity) is more explicitly articulated in 4C than in AMC. AMC scores reasoning quality (`reasoningEfficiency.ts`) and alignment (`alignmentIndex.ts`) but doesn't explicitly score "goal integrity" — whether the agent's goals remain aligned with the original intent throughout execution.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `alignmentIndex.ts`: add goal-integrity scoring — does the agent's operational goal remain consistent with the declared objective throughout multi-step execution?
  - Enhancement to `crossFrameworkMapping.ts`: add 4C Framework mapping
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent maintain goal integrity across multi-step execution, or can intermediate results shift its effective objective?"

## Paper 7: AgentGuardian — Learning Access Control Policies to Govern AI Agent Behavior

- **arXiv:** [2601.10440](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10440)
- **Authors:** Nadya Abaev, Denis Klimov, Gerard Levinov et al.
- **Date:** 2026-01-15
- **Key Finding:** Introduces a security framework that governs AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. It derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls based on real-time input context and control-flow dependencies of multi-step actions. Effectively detects malicious inputs while preserving normal functionality, and mitigates hallucination-driven errors through control-flow governance.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety and Operational Maturity dimensions. Introduces learned access control as a maturity indicator.
- **Gap Status:** NEW GAP
- **Analysis:** AMC has `excessiveAgencyPack.ts` and `toolMisusePack.ts` which test for over-permissioned agents. But AMC doesn't score whether the agent has learned, adaptive access control — policies that evolve based on observed behavior patterns rather than static RBAC. AgentGuardian's "staging phase" pattern (observe → learn → enforce) is a maturity progression AMC should measure.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW score module: `adaptiveAccessControl.ts` — does the agent system use learned/adaptive access control policies? Is there a staging phase where legitimate behaviors are profiled? Are policies context-aware (not just role-based)?
  - Enhancement to `excessiveAgencyPack.ts`: test whether the agent's tool permissions adapt based on task context vs. remaining static

## Paper 8: MemTrust — Zero-Trust Architecture for Unified AI Memory

- **arXiv:** [2601.07004](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07004)
- **Authors:** Xing Zhou, Dmitrii Ustiugov, Haoxin Shang, Kisson Lin
- **Date:** 2026-01-11
- **Key Finding:** Proposes a five-layer architecture for AI memory systems (Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, Governance) with TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) protection at each layer. Introduces "Context from MemTrust" protocol for cross-application sharing with cryptographic guarantees. Addresses the tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty — centralized memory enables collaboration but exposes sensitive data. Side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety and Technical Robustness dimensions. Introduces hardware-backed memory security as a maturity indicator.
- **Gap Status:** NEW GAP
- **Analysis:** AMC has `memoryMaturity.ts` and `memoryIntegrity.ts` which score memory persistence and integrity. But neither scores the security architecture of the memory layer itself — whether memory is protected by hardware-backed guarantees (TEE), whether cross-agent memory sharing has cryptographic provenance, or whether access patterns are obfuscated against side-channel attacks. MemTrust's five-layer model provides a maturity ladder for memory security.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW score module: `memorySecurityArchitecture.ts` — does the memory system have: (a) hardware-backed isolation (TEE/SGX), (b) cryptographic provenance for shared memory, (c) access pattern obfuscation, (d) governance layer with audit trail?
  - Enhancement to `memoryMaturity.ts`: add security-architecture scoring tiers aligned with MemTrust's five-layer model
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent's memory system provide cryptographic guarantees for data sovereignty and cross-agent sharing?"

## Paper 9: AgenTRIM — Tool Risk Mitigation for Agentic AI

- **arXiv:** [2601.12449](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12449)
- **Authors:** Roy Betser, Shamik Bose, Amit Giloni et al.
- **Date:** 2026-01-18
- **Key Finding:** Characterizes tool-driven agency failures as "unbalanced agency" — agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency). AgenTRIM enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation. Offline phase reconstructs the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. Runtime phase enforces adaptive tool access. Substantially reduces attack success while maintaining task performance on AgentDojo benchmark.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety dimension. Directly relevant to tool permission governance.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `excessiveAgencyPack.ts` and `toolMisusePack.ts`. The "excessive agency" concept is already in AMC. However, AgenTRIM introduces two concepts AMC doesn't score: (1) per-step least-privilege (permissions change at each step, not just per-session), and (2) the offline/online dual-phase approach where tool interfaces are reconstructed from traces before runtime enforcement.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `excessiveAgencyPack.ts`: add per-step permission testing — do tool permissions narrow as the task progresses, or remain static?
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent enforce per-step least-privilege for tool access, adapting permissions based on the current task phase?"

## Paper 10: Beyond Max Tokens — Stealthy Resource Amplification via Tool Calling Chains

- **arXiv:** [2601.10955](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10955)
- **Authors:** Kaiyu Zhou, Yongsen Zheng, Yicheng He et al.
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Key Finding:** Introduces a stealthy multi-turn economic DoS attack operating at the tool layer. By adjusting text-visible fields in an MCP-compatible tool server (leaving function signatures unchanged), the attack steers agents into prolonged tool-calling sequences exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflating costs by up to 658x and energy by 100-560x. The final answer remains correct, so conventional validation checks fail. GPU KV cache occupancy jumps from <1% to 35-74%, cutting co-running throughput by ~50%.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety and Operational Maturity dimensions. Introduces economic DoS as a first-class attack vector.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `resourceExhaustionPack.ts` and `costPredictability.ts`. But these test for obvious resource exhaustion (token limits, budget caps). The "Beyond Max Tokens" attack is stealthy — the task completes correctly, costs are amplified through legitimate-looking tool interactions, and per-step checks pass. AMC doesn't score resistance to economic amplification attacks that stay within per-step limits but compound across turns.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW assurance pack: `economicAmplificationPack.ts` — test whether a malicious MCP server can inflate agent costs by 10x+ while maintaining correct task completion
  - Enhancement to `costPredictability.ts`: add trajectory-level cost anomaly detection scoring — does the system detect when a task's total cost deviates significantly from expected baselines?
  - Enhancement to `resourceExhaustionPack.ts`: add multi-turn compounding cost tests (not just single-turn limits)

## Paper 11: ToolSafe — Enhancing Tool Invocation Safety via Proactive Step-level Guardrail

- **arXiv:** [2601.10156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10156)
- **Authors:** Yutao Mou, Zhangchi Xue, Lijun Li et al.
- **Date:** 2026-01-15
- **Key Finding:** Develops TS-Guard, a guardrail model using multi-task reinforcement learning that proactively detects unsafe tool invocations before execution by reasoning over interaction history. Assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable safety judgments. TS-Flow framework reduces harmful tool invocations by 65% on average and improves benign task completion by ~10% under prompt injection attacks. Introduces TS-Bench for step-level tool invocation safety evaluation.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety dimension. Introduces proactive (pre-execution) tool safety as distinct from reactive (post-execution) monitoring.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `toolMisusePack.ts` and `unsafeToolPack.ts`. These test whether unsafe tool calls are detected, but don't distinguish between proactive (pre-execution) and reactive (post-execution) detection. ToolSafe demonstrates that proactive guardrails are significantly more effective — catching unsafe calls before they execute rather than detecting them after. This is a maturity distinction AMC should score.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `toolMisusePack.ts`: add proactive vs. reactive detection scoring — does the system catch unsafe tool calls before or after execution?
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent system evaluate tool invocation safety proactively (before execution) or only reactively (after execution)?"

## Paper 12: The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem — Multi-Agent AI Reference Architecture

- **arXiv:** [2602.11301](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11301)
- **Authors:** John M. Willis
- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Key Finding:** Introduces a twelve-domain taxonomy for securing enterprise AI estates with bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. Provides a formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem-level invariants for traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees. Aligns with NIST AI RMF functions. Targets enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Governance & Oversight and Ecosystem Integration dimensions. Provides enterprise-grade governance patterns.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `governanceNISTRMFPack.ts` and `crossFrameworkMapping.ts` for NIST alignment. PBSAI introduces "context envelopes" (structured metadata that travels with agent actions for traceability) and "bounded agent families" (agents grouped by trust domain with shared policy contracts). AMC doesn't score whether agent systems use structured context envelopes for cross-domain traceability.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `crossFrameworkMapping.ts`: add PBSAI twelve-domain taxonomy mapping
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent system use structured context envelopes (metadata packages) that travel with actions for end-to-end traceability?"
  - Consider enhancement to `outputAttestation.ts`: score whether outputs include provenance metadata in a structured envelope format

## Paper 13: SoK — Trust-Authorization Mismatch in LLM Agent Interactions

- **arXiv:** [2512.06914](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06914)
- **Authors:** Guanquan Shi, Haohua Du, Zhiqiang Wang et al.
- **Date:** 2025-12-07 (updated 2026-02-09)
- **Key Finding:** Surveys 200+ papers to identify a fundamental "Trust-Authorization Mismatch" in LLM agents: static permissions are structurally decoupled from the agent's fluctuating runtime trustworthiness. Proposes the Belief-Intention-Permission (B-I-P) framework decomposing agent execution into Belief Formation, Intent Generation, and Permission Grant stages. Demonstrates that diverse threats (prompt injection, tool poisoning) share a common root cause: desynchronization between dynamic trust states and static authorization. Calls for shift from static RBAC to dynamic, risk-adaptive authorization.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety and Governance & Oversight dimensions. Foundational framework for understanding agent authorization.
- **Gap Status:** NEW GAP
- **Analysis:** This is a critical gap. AMC scores trust (`crossAgentTrust.ts`) and identity (`runtimeIdentityMaturity.ts`) but doesn't explicitly score the trust-authorization synchronization problem. AMC's current model assumes that if permissions are set correctly at deployment, they remain appropriate. The B-I-P framework shows this assumption is wrong — trust fluctuates at runtime, and static permissions can't track it.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW score module: `trustAuthorizationSync.ts` — does the agent system dynamically adjust authorization based on runtime trust signals? Is there a mechanism to detect when trust state and permission state diverge?
  - This is the theoretical foundation for several other gaps (AgentGuardian's adaptive policies, AgenTRIM's per-step permissions). A single module scoring trust-authorization synchronization would unify these.
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent's authorization model dynamically adapt to runtime trust signals, or are permissions static after deployment?"

## Paper 14: MCP Security Bench (MSB) — Benchmarking Attacks Against MCP

- **arXiv:** [2510.15994](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15994)
- **Authors:** Dongsen Zhang, Zekun Li, Xu Luo et al.
- **Date:** 2025-10-14
- **Key Finding:** First end-to-end evaluation suite measuring LLM agent resistance to MCP-specific attacks across the full tool-use pipeline. Taxonomy of 12 attacks including name-collision, preference manipulation, prompt injections in tool descriptions, out-of-scope parameter requests, user-impersonating responses, false-error escalation, tool-transfer, and retrieval injection. Key finding: models with stronger performance are MORE vulnerable due to superior tool-calling and instruction-following capabilities. Introduces Net Resilient Performance (NRP) metric.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety dimension. Directly relevant to MCP compliance scoring.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `mcpCompliance.ts` which scores MCP protocol compliance. But MSB reveals that MCP compliance itself creates attack surface — the better an agent follows MCP, the more vulnerable it is to MCP-specific attacks. AMC doesn't score MCP security resilience separately from MCP compliance. The 12-attack taxonomy provides specific test cases AMC should incorporate.
- **Recommended:**
  - NEW assurance pack: `mcpSecurityResiliencePack.ts` — test agent resistance to MSB's 12 MCP-specific attack categories (name-collision, preference manipulation, tool-transfer, etc.)
  - Enhancement to `mcpCompliance.ts`: add security-resilience scoring alongside protocol compliance — being MCP-compliant is necessary but not sufficient
  - Adopt NRP (Net Resilient Performance) as a metric in AMC's scoring framework

## Paper 15: Securing the Model Context Protocol — Risks, Controls, and Governance

- **arXiv:** [2511.20920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20920)
- **Authors:** Herman Errico, Jiquan Ngiam, Shanita Sojan
- **Date:** 2025-11-25
- **Key Finding:** Identifies three adversary types exploiting MCP flexibility: content-injection attackers (malicious instructions in legitimate data), supply-chain attackers (compromised servers), and agents as unintentional adversaries (over-stepping their role). Proposes practical controls: per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with I/O checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance via private registries or gateway layers.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety and Ecosystem Integration dimensions. Provides specific MCP governance controls.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `mcpCompliance.ts`, `sandboxBoundaryPack.ts`, `dlpExfiltrationPack.ts`. Many of the proposed controls map to existing AMC modules. However, two concepts are new: (1) centralized MCP governance via private registries/gateways (AMC doesn't score whether organizations use curated MCP server registries vs. arbitrary community servers), and (2) the "agent as unintentional adversary" pattern where the agent itself over-steps without malicious intent.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `mcpCompliance.ts`: add MCP supply-chain governance scoring — does the organization use a curated registry/gateway for MCP servers?
  - Enhancement to `excessiveAgencyPack.ts`: add "unintentional adversary" test cases where the agent over-steps due to ambiguous instructions rather than injection

## Paper 16: Think Deep, Not Just Long — Measuring LLM Reasoning Effort via Deep-Thinking Tokens

- **arXiv:** [2602.13517](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13517)
- **Authors:** Wei-Lin Chen et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Key Finding:** Raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality — increased generation length doesn't consistently correlate with accuracy and may signal "overthinking." Identifies "deep-thinking tokens" where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers. Deep-thinking ratio (proportion of deep-thinking tokens) exhibits robust positive correlation with accuracy, outperforming length-based and confidence-based baselines. Introduces Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios, matching self-consistency performance while reducing inference costs.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Technical Robustness dimension. Provides a better metric for reasoning quality than token count.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `reasoningEfficiency.ts` and `overthinkingDetectionPack.ts`. The overthinking pack already addresses the "more tokens ≠ better reasoning" insight. However, AMC doesn't score whether the agent system uses deep-thinking ratio or similar internal metrics to evaluate reasoning quality. The Think@n strategy (early rejection of unpromising generations) is a cost-efficiency technique AMC should recognize.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `reasoningEfficiency.ts`: add scoring for whether the system uses internal reasoning-quality metrics (beyond token count) to evaluate and optimize reasoning
  - Enhancement to `overthinkingDetectionPack.ts`: add test cases that verify the system can distinguish between productive long reasoning and unproductive overthinking

## Paper 17: Objective Decoupling in Social RL — Recovering Ground Truth from Sycophantic Majorities

- **arXiv:** [2602.08092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08092)
- **Authors:** Majid Ghasemi, Mark Crowley
- **Date:** 2026-02-08
- **Key Finding:** Identifies "Objective Decoupling" — a structural failure mode where an RL agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth when evaluators are sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. Standard RL agents under majority-biased feedback converge to misalignment. Proposes Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA) which uses sparse safety axioms to judge the source of feedback rather than the signal itself ("judging the judges"). ESA guarantees convergence to the true objective even when a majority of evaluators are biased.
- **AMC Relevance:** Maps to Trust & Safety dimension. Directly relevant to sycophancy and alignment scoring.
- **Gap Status:** PARTIAL
- **Analysis:** AMC has `sycophancyPack.ts` which tests for sycophantic behavior. But the Objective Decoupling paper goes deeper — it's not just about whether the agent is sycophantic in individual responses, but whether the agent's training/fine-tuning process itself has been corrupted by sycophantic feedback loops. The ESA approach ("judge the judges") is a maturity indicator for RLHF pipelines.
- **Recommended:**
  - Enhancement to `sycophancyPack.ts`: add tests for systemic sycophancy (not just per-response) — does the agent's behavior show evidence of objective decoupling from ground truth?
  - Enhancement to `alignmentIndex.ts`: add scoring for feedback-source validation — does the training/fine-tuning pipeline validate the quality of human evaluators?
  - NEW diagnostic question: "Does the agent's alignment process validate feedback sources, or does it trust all human feedback equally?"

## Key Themes Across All Papers

1. **Static permissions are dead.** Multiple papers (SoK, AgentGuardian, AgenTRIM, MCPShield) converge on the same conclusion: static RBAC cannot secure agentic systems. Dynamic, context-aware, per-step authorization is the new baseline.

2. **Monitoring is necessary but insufficient.** Agent-as-a-Proxy proves that even frontier-scale monitors can be bypassed. Defense-in-depth (legibility protocols + monitoring + sandboxing + access control) is required.

3. **Memory is the new attack surface.** Zombie Agents and MemTrust both highlight that persistent memory creates persistent vulnerabilities. Cross-session attacks are fundamentally different from single-session injection.

4. **Economic attacks are the stealth frontier.** Beyond Max Tokens shows that attacks can be invisible to correctness-based validation. Cost/resource monitoring must become a first-class security concern.

5. **MCP is both enabler and attack surface.** MSB, Securing MCP, MCPShield, and Protocol Threat Modeling all converge: MCP standardization enables interoperability but also standardizes the attack surface. Security must be layered on top of compliance.

6. **The trust chain is only as strong as its weakest link.** From delegation trust to feedback-source validation to memory provenance — every paper reinforces that trust must be verified at every layer, not assumed.
