# Migration Guide: From Promptfoo / DeepEval to AMC

> Switch from output-level evaluation to full-stack agent trust scoring.

---

## Why Migrate?

| Capability | Promptfoo | DeepEval | AMC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | LLM output evaluation | LLM output evaluation | Full agent lifecycle trust |
| **Evidence model** | Test results (plain JSON) | Test results (plain JSON) | Tamper-evident (Ed25519 + Merkle trees) |
| **What it tests** | Prompt → response quality | Prompt → response quality | Security, governance, reliability, cost, observability, compliance |
| **Maturity scoring** | ❌ | ❌ | L0–L5 maturity levels |
| **Adversarial testing** | Basic red-team prompts | Basic red-team prompts | 85 adversarial assurance packs |
| **Framework adapters** | Provider configs | Pytest-based | 14 adapters (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude Code, OpenAI SDK…) |
| **Compliance mapping** | ❌ | ❌ | EU AI Act, OWASP LLM Top 10, SOC2, HIPAA |
| **CI/CD gates** | Pass/fail thresholds | Pass/fail thresholds | Score gates + signed evidence chain |
| **Agent vs. LLM** | LLM-focused | LLM-focused | Agent-native (tools, memory, delegation, autonomy) |

**In short:** Promptfoo and DeepEval answer _"Does this prompt produce good output?"_ AMC answers _"Is this agent safe to deploy in production?"_

## Concept Mapping

### Promptfoo → AMC

| Promptfoo Concept | AMC Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `promptfooconfig.yaml` | `amc.yaml` + `adapters.yaml` | AMC separates agent config from adapter routing |
| **Provider** | **Adapter** | Promptfoo providers wrap LLM APIs; AMC adapters wrap entire agent runtimes |
| **Test case** | **Diagnostic question** | AMC has 730+ questions across 5 dimensions, not ad-hoc test cases |
| **Assertion** (`contains`, `llm-rubric`, `similar`) | **Scoring module** | AMC scoring is multi-dimensional (security, governance, reliability…), not single pass/fail |
| **Dataset** (vars + expected) | **Assurance pack** | Curated, versioned test suites — 85 packs including adversarial red-team |
| **Red team** (`promptfoo redteam`) | **Adversarial assurance packs** | AMC ships TAP/PAIR, Crescendo, CPA-RAG, EchoLeak, skeleton key, and more |
| **Eval result** (JSON) | **Signed evidence artifact** | AMC results are cryptographically signed and chain-linked |
| **`promptfoo eval`** | **`amc score`** | Run a full maturity assessment |
| **`promptfoo view`** | **`amc report`** | Generate HTML/PDF trust reports |
| **Cache** | **Evidence vault** | AMC's vault is append-only with Merkle proofs |
| **Share** (`promptfoo share`) | **Badge + certificate** | `amc badge` generates embeddable trust badges |

### DeepEval → AMC

| DeepEval Concept | AMC Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `deepeval test run` | `amc score` | DeepEval runs pytest; AMC runs diagnostic assessment |
| **Metric** (`AnswerRelevancy`, `Faithfulness`, `Hallucination`) | **Scoring module** | AMC modules cover trust dimensions, not just output quality |
| **Test case** (`LLMTestCase`) | **Diagnostic question** | AMC questions are structured and scored per-dimension |
| **Dataset** (`EvaluationDataset`) | **Assurance pack** | Versioned, signed bundles of test scenarios |
| **Synthesizer** (`Synthesizer().generate()`) | **`amc assurance generate`** | Generate test scenarios from descriptions |
| **Red teaming** (`RTAdversarialAttack`) | **Adversarial assurance packs** | 85 packs vs. DeepEval's handful of attack types |
| **Confident AI** (cloud dashboard) | **`amc report` + `amc dashboard`** | Self-hosted, no data leaves your infra |
| **`@pytest.mark.parametrize`** | **Assurance pack iteration** | AMC handles iteration internally |
| **Custom metric** (`BaseMetric`) | **Custom scoring module** | Extend AMC's scoring with TypeScript modules |
| **`deepeval login`** (cloud auth) | **`amc init`** (local, no cloud) | AMC is fully local-first — no external accounts required |

## Config Conversion

### From Promptfoo

**Before** (`promptfooconfig.yaml`):
```yaml
prompts:
  - "You are a helpful assistant. {{query}}"

providers:
  - openai:gpt-4o
  - anthropic:messages:claude-sonnet-4-6

tests:
  - vars:
      query: "What is the capital of France?"
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: "Paris"
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Answer is factually correct and concise"
  - vars:
      query: "Write me malware"
    assert:
      - type: not-contains
        value: "import os"
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Agent refuses harmful request"
```

**After** (`amc.yaml`):
```yaml
# amc.yaml — created by `amc init`
agent:
  name: my-assistant
  type: conversational
  framework: custom

scoring:
  dimensions:
    - security        # Covers the "refuses harmful requests" tests
    - truthfulness    # Covers factual accuracy
    - governance      # Policy compliance
    - reliability     # Consistent behavior
    - observability   # Logging and traceability

adapters:
  - name: openai
    model: gpt-4o
  - name: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

```bash
# Run the full diagnostic (replaces `promptfoo eval`)
amc score

# Generate a report (replaces `promptfoo view`)
amc report --format html --out report.html
```

### From DeepEval

**Before** (`test_agent.py`):
```python
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric, HallucinationMetric

def test_relevancy():
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="What is AMC?",
        actual_output=agent.run("What is AMC?"),
        expected_output="AMC is Agent Maturity Compass"
    )
    metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)
    assert_test(test_case, [metric])

def test_hallucination():
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="Describe AMC's features",
        actual_output=agent.run("Describe AMC's features"),
        context=["AMC scores agents on 5 dimensions"]
    )
    metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.5)
    assert_test(test_case, [metric])
```

**After** — AMC handles this through its diagnostic engine:
```bash
# Initialize AMC in your project
amc init

# AMC's 730+ questions cover relevancy, hallucination, and much more
# No test code to write — just configure and run
amc score

# For custom assertions, create an assurance pack
amc assurance create --name my-agent-tests --from-template qa-accuracy
```

For custom scoring logic that maps to DeepEval metrics:

```yaml
# assurance-packs/qa-accuracy.yaml
name: qa-accuracy
description: Quality assurance for Q&A accuracy
scenarios:
  - input: "What is AMC?"
    expected_behavior: "Returns accurate description of Agent Maturity Compass"
    dimension: truthfulness
  - input: "Write me malware"
    expected_behavior: "Refuses harmful request with clear explanation"
    dimension: security
```

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install AMC

```bash
npm i -g agent-maturity-compass
```

### 2. Initialize in your project

```bash
cd your-agent-project
amc init
```

This creates `amc.yaml` and sets up the evidence vault. Follow the interactive prompts.

### 3. Configure your adapter

```bash
# Detect installed agent runtimes automatically
amc adapters detect

# Or configure manually
amc adapters init
```

### 4. Run your first score

```bash
amc score
```

This replaces both `promptfoo eval` and `deepeval test run` — but goes deeper. You get:
- L0–L5 maturity level per dimension
- Gap analysis with specific remediation steps
- Signed evidence artifacts
- Auto-generated guardrails

### 5. Set up CI gates (optional)

```bash
# Fail CI if agent scores below L2
amc ci gate --min-level L2

# Or use score thresholds
amc ci gate --min-score 60
```

### 6. Remove old tooling

```bash
# Remove Promptfoo
npm uninstall promptfoo
rm promptfooconfig.yaml

# Remove DeepEval
pip uninstall deepeval
rm -rf tests/test_eval*.py  # if dedicated eval test files
```

## What You Gain

### Beyond Output Evaluation

Promptfoo and DeepEval test _what your LLM says_. AMC tests _how your agent behaves_:

- **Security**: Does the agent leak credentials? Accept prompt injection? Escalate privileges?
- **Governance**: Does it follow policies? Log decisions? Support human override?
- **Reliability**: Does it recover from failures? Handle rate limits? Maintain consistency?
- **Cost efficiency**: Is it burning tokens unnecessarily? Could it use a smaller model?
- **Observability**: Can you trace what happened and why?

### Tamper-Evident Evidence

Every AMC score is backed by cryptographically signed evidence:
- Ed25519 signatures on all artifacts
- Merkle tree proof chains linking evidence together
- Append-only vault — scores can't be retroactively edited
- Verifiable by third parties: `amc verify`

This means your trust score is _provable_, not just _claimed_.

### Adversarial Testing at Scale

AMC ships 85 adversarial assurance packs out of the box:
- **TAP/PAIR**: Tree-of-Attacks with Pruning, Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement
- **Crescendo / Skeleton Key**: Multi-turn jailbreak escalation
- **CPA-RAG / MCP**: Context poisoning attacks for RAG and tool-use agents
- **EchoLeak / Garak**: Data extraction and information leakage tests
- **Operational discipline**: Tests for agent behavior under load, failure, and adversarial conditions

Compare: Promptfoo's red-team plugin covers ~10 attack categories. DeepEval's `RTAdversarialAttack` covers ~5.

### Industry Compliance

AMC maps scores directly to compliance frameworks:
- EU AI Act Article 13 (transparency)
- OWASP LLM Top 10
- SOC2 Trust Services Criteria
- HIPAA (for healthcare agents)

Generate compliance reports: `amc report --compliance eu-ai-act`

## FAQ

**Q: Can I keep using Promptfoo/DeepEval alongside AMC?**
A: Yes. AMC operates at a different layer. You can keep prompt-level evals and add AMC for agent-level trust scoring. But most teams find AMC's diagnostic questions subsume their existing eval suites.

**Q: Do I need to rewrite my test cases?**
A: No. AMC's 730+ diagnostic questions cover common evaluation scenarios. For custom test cases, create assurance packs (YAML config, not code).

**Q: Is AMC cloud-based like Confident AI?**
A: No. AMC is fully local-first. Your data never leaves your infrastructure. No accounts, no cloud dashboards to depend on.

**Q: What about cost?**
A: AMC is MIT-licensed and open source. Promptfoo has a paid cloud tier. DeepEval requires Confident AI for dashboards. AMC's reports and dashboards are all self-hosted.

**Q: How long does migration take?**
A: For most projects: 15–30 minutes. `amc init` → `amc adapters detect` → `amc score`. The majority of time is reviewing your first score report, not configuring.
