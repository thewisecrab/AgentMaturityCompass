## Console Capability Matrix

| Page | URL | Scope | What it shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Host Portfolio | `/host/console` | Host | Workspace list, readiness, access links |
| Main Console | `/w/:id/console` or `/console` | Workspace | RBAC app shell and live status |
| Org | `/w/:id/console/org.html` | Workspace | Org tree, trust labels, scorecards |
| Compare | `/w/:id/console/compare.html` | Workspace | Node-vs-node deltas and gap/win lists |
| Systemic | `/w/:id/console/systemic.html` | Workspace | 5 strategy-failure risks + contributors |
| Transform | `/w/:id/console/transform.html` | Workspace | 4C progress + kanban tasks |
| Mechanic Mode | `/w/:id/console/mechanic.html` | Workspace | 126-question equalizer + what-if + target apply |
| Forecast | `/w/:id/console/forecast*.html` | Workspace | Trend bands, drift/anomaly warnings, ETA |
| Advisories | `/w/:id/console/advisories.html` | Workspace | Evidence-bound warnings and acknowledgements |
| Benchmarks | `/w/:id/console/bench*.html` | Workspace + Host | Exports/imports, registry browse, percentiles, portfolio compare |
| Plugins | `/w/:id/console/plugins.html` | Workspace | Registries, install/upgrade/remove, approval progress |
| Trust | `/w/:id/console/trust.html` | Workspace | Trust mode, notary health, attestation details |

## Security Boundary Matrix

| Boundary | Enforced By | Result |
|---|---|---|
| OWNER/OPERATOR/AUDITOR/VIEWER vs AGENT | RBAC + lease-only paths | Agents cannot perform owner/admin/ops actions |
| Host vs Workspace | URL routing + membership + workspace contexts | Strict multi-tenant isolation |
| Lease workspace binding | Lease claim `workspaceId` | Agent traffic cannot cross workspace boundaries |
| Vault vs Notary signing | `trust.yaml` enforcement | Fail-closed signing in NOTARY mode |
| Registry trust | Pinned fingerprints + signature verification | Plugin/bench imports blocked on trust mismatch |
| Config tamper detection | Signed YAML + readiness checks | Untrusted configs force warnings and 503 readiness |
| Evidence integrity | Hash-chain ledger + transparency + merkle | Tamper-evident event history |

## Signing Matrix (Who Signs What)

| Artifact/Record | Signer Type |
|---|---|
| Configs (`action-policy`, `tools`, `budgets`, `approval-policy`, `ops-policy`, `org`, `transform-map`, `bench policy`, `identity`, `registries`) | VAULT or NOTARY (per trust enforcement) |
| Transparency roots + Merkle roots | VAULT or NOTARY (required kinds fail-closed in NOTARY mode) |
| Plugin installed lock + plugin actions | VAULT or NOTARY (if required by trust policy) |
| Transform plans + transform attestations | VAULT or NOTARY |
| Org scorecards + commitments | VAULT or NOTARY |
| Release manifest (`.amcrelease`) | Release keypair (separate from workspace vault keys) or NOTARY when required by trust enforcement |
| Backup manifest (`.amcbackup`) | VAULT or NOTARY |
| Benchmark artifact signatures (`.amcbench`) | VAULT or NOTARY |
