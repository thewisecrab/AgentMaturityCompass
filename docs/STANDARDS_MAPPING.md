# AMC Standards Mapping
**Agent Maturity Certification — Cross-Standard Alignment Reference**
*Version 1.0 | Generated 2026-02-19*

---

## Executive Summary

AMC is a **superset** of existing AI and software maturity standards. Each major framework covers a slice of what enterprises need when deploying AI agents. AMC covers *all* of their territory and adds agent-specific dimensions none of them address.

| Standard | Coverage Focus | What AMC Adds |
|---|---|---|
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk identification, measurement, and management for AI | Execution-proof evidence, agent-specific behavioral controls, self-improvement loop |
| **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** | AI management system structure & documentation | Automated scoring, CMMI-style maturity levels, agent orchestration controls |
| **CMMI (v2.0)** | Process maturity for software/service organizations | AI-specific dimensions: prompt injection defense, token cost governance, multi-agent reliability |
| **EU AI Act** | Legal compliance for high-risk AI systems | Quantitative scoring, gap remediation roadmap, evidence collection automation |
| **Microsoft Responsible AI** | Principles-based guidelines | Operational enforcement modules, not just principles |
| **Google/HF Model Cards** | Single-model documentation | Org-level agent maturity, multi-model environments, operating model coverage |

**Bottom line:** AMC operationalizes these standards into 5 dimensions, 87 scored questions, and executable evidence modules. It is the only framework that combines *assessment*, *evidence*, *improvement*, and *certification* in a single automated system.

## CMMI Level Alignment

| CMMI Level | Description | AMC Maturity Level | Typical AMC Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1 — Initial** | Ad hoc, unpredictable | L1 (Ad Hoc) | 0–39 |
| **Level 2 — Managed** | Project-level management, some policies | L2 (Developing) | 40–59 |
| **Level 3 — Defined** | Org-wide standards, tailored processes | L3 (Defined) | 60–74 |
| **Level 4 — Quantitatively Managed** | Statistical process control, measurement | L4 (Optimized) | 75–89 |
| **Level 5 — Optimizing** | Continuous improvement, innovation | L5 (Autonomous) | 90–100 |

AMC's L1→L5 scale directly mirrors CMMI's 1–5 progression, making AMC reports directly translatable for organizations already using CMMI for software processes.

## Dimensions AMC Covers That No Existing Standard Addresses

1. **Prompt Injection Defense at Runtime** — All standards acknowledge adversarial threats in principle; none specify runtime injection detection as a maturity dimension.

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Reliability** — No existing standard addresses consensus mechanisms, loop detection, or coordination patterns for multi-agent systems.

3. **Token Cost Governance** — Cost efficiency is absent from NIST, ISO 42001, and EU AI Act. AMC treats it as a first-class operational maturity indicator.

4. **Execution-Proof Evidence Collection** — Existing standards require "documentation"; AMC requires *executable proof* via module-level test harnesses.

5. **Self-Improvement Loop** — AMC includes a FixGenerator that reads current gaps and automatically generates improvement code. No standard frameworks include this.

6. **Agent-Specific RACI** — Traditional RACI matrices don't distinguish between model ownership, tool ownership, and agent system ownership. AMC does.

7. **Autonomy Dial** — AMC measures the calibration between agent autonomy level and risk thresholds. Existing standards treat autonomy as binary (human vs. automated).

## How to Use This Document

**For compliance teams:** Use this mapping to demonstrate that AMC certification satisfies requirements across multiple standards simultaneously. An AMC L3 score provides documented evidence for NIST AI RMF MAP/MEASURE functions, ISO 42001 Clauses 6–9, and EU AI Act Articles 9–15.

**For procurement:** Request AMC scores as a proxy for multi-standard compliance readiness without requiring separate assessments for each standard.

**For engineering teams:** Use the dimension-to-article mapping to prioritize improvements based on which regulatory requirement each module addresses.
