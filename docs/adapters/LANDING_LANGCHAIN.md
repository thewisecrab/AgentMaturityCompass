# AMC for LangChain Users

You already use LangChain. AMC wraps it — zero code changes.

## Why this matters
LangChain gives you agent orchestration. AMC gives you trust evidence for what that agent actually does.

## Get started

```bash
# Wrap your existing LangChain agent
amc wrap langchain -- python my_agent.py

# Score it
amc quickscore

# See what gaps exist
amc fix
```

## What you get
- Execution evidence from real LangChain runs
- Trust scoring across 5 dimensions
- Adversarial assurance against prompt injection, exfiltration, and more
- CI gates that prevent trust regressions
