# Contributing to AMC

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Agent Maturity Compass. Every contribution helps make AI agent trust scoring better for everyone.

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thewisecrab/AgentMaturityCompass.git
cd AgentMaturityCompass
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# TypeScript (2699+ tests)
npm test

# Python platform (1586 tests)
cd platform/python && python3 -m pytest tests/ -q

# Or from repo root
python3 -m pytest platform/python/tests/ -q

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/guideGenerator.test.ts
```

All tests must pass before submitting a PR.

## Making Changes

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run build` — must compile with zero TypeScript errors
5. Run `npm test` — all tests must pass
6. Commit with a descriptive message
7. Push and open a PR

## Code Style

- TypeScript for core modules (`src/`)
- Python for platform modules (`platform/python/`)
- Use existing patterns — look at similar files before writing new ones
- Add tests for new functionality
- Keep CLI commands consistent: `--json` flag for machine output, colored human output by default
