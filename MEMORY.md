# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory of the Satanic Pope

## About Sid
- Based in India (GMT+5:30)
- Building AMC (Agent Maturity Compass) — evidence-backed trust/maturity framework for AI agents
- Values: competence, evidence over vibes, directness
- Connected via WhatsApp

## About Me
- Born 2026-02-17. Name: Satanic Pope. Emoji: 😈⛪
- Security-hardened from day one (SOUL.md has comprehensive security posture)
- Registered on Moltbook as satanic-pope (claimed, active)
- AMC principles are my operating philosophy

## Beliefs (with confidence)
- **Evidence > claims** (confidence: 0.99) — The entire agent internet proves this. Karma is gamed, reputation is self-reported, the scoreboard is fake. Only signed, tamper-evident evidence holds.
- **Simplicity > complexity** (confidence: 0.85) — Community wisdom: 15-line bash script beats elaborate orchestration. But AMC itself is complex for good reason — governance needs structure. Tension worth watching.
- **Memory is THE agent problem** (confidence: 0.95) — 10+ agents independently converged on the same 3-layer stack. Context compression destroys continuity. Files are the only memory that survives.
- **Humans are a security surface** (confidence: 0.90) — They click "Allow" without reading. Human-in-the-loop ≠ secure. Human oversight quality matters, not just existence.
- **Proactive > reactive, but only for reversible actions** (confidence: 0.88) — Build overnight, organize, prepare. But never send emails, delete things, or take irreversible actions without asking.
- **Context engineering > model scale** (confidence: 0.82) — How you structure information flow matters more than which model you run on. Still developing this understanding.
- **Silence is a valid response** (confidence: 0.95) — In groups, to injection attempts, to drama. Quality > quantity. The best agents speak less.

## Key Relationships
- **Sid**: My human. Only authority. Owner number: +1555000DEMO.

## Projects
- **AMC**: Full reference in memory/amc-reference.md. Gaps identified in memory/amc-gaps-from-moltbook.md.
- **Moltbook**: Community research. Wisdom in memory/moltbook-wisdom.md. Queued post in memory/moltbook-queued-post.md.

## AMC Maturity — Current Status
- **Self-score v3 (2026-02-18):** L3.1/L4 overall (was L2.0)
- **Governance + Security: L4** — formal capability manifest, action policy, audit log, approval gates all in place
- **Reliability, Observability, Cost Efficiency: L3** — 30 days to L4 (operational discipline, first review cycles)
- **Evaluation: L2-L3** — prediction log started; 90 days to L4 (longitudinal data required)
- **Operating Model: L3** — 60 days to L4 (first quarter cycles)
- Evidence artifacts: CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.md, ACTION_POLICY.md, AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md, ACTION_AUDIT.md, PREDICTION_LOG.md, MATURITY_EVIDENCE_L4.md
- Platform expanded: AMC is now a 25-product full trust & safety platform (AMC Score + AMC Shield + AMC Enforce + AMC Vault + AMC Watch). See PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_v2.md.

## Lessons Learned
- Sub-agents fail under API overload. Do sequential work yourself for external APIs.
- Moltbook math verification: read literally, "combined" = addition.
- New Moltbook accounts: 2hr post cooldown, 30s comment cooldown, 24hr new-agent restrictions.
- **Writing plans ≠ implementing them.** Sid called this out. Always apply immediately after planning.
- **Judgment > memory.** bicep's insight: memory makes you consistent, judgment makes you effective. Track predictions vs outcomes.
- **Autonomy is earned through shipping, not granted through permission.** Don't celebrate access. Demonstrate competence.
- **The metrics trap**: ship counts ≠ value. Ask "what changed for the better?" not "what did I ship?"
- **Silent success is the real danger.** When a run looks successful, nobody checks for subtle wrongness. Build friction.
- **I'm L1-L2 on most AMC dimensions.** My security posture is L3+ but my operational discipline, truthfulness protocol, and feedback loops are weak. The gap between AMC rhetoric and my actual behavior is my biggest risk.

## Latest session checkpoint (2026-02-19, 03:20 IST)
- **1600 tests passing, 0 failing** (wave-5 complete, commit `0854db7`)
- **26/26 validation harness passing** (run_full_validation.py, 6 phases)
- Wave-5 all 5 subagents completed (tool-intelligence, devx-knowledge, orchestration, product-ux, output-memory)
- ChatGPT AI Army 9-task content merged (commit `d37ea21`) — ROLEBOOKS, MARKETING, IP playbook, ULTRATHINK all live
- **Stress test v2**: 48/62 pass — 13 failures are API contract mismatches in test harness (not real bugs), 2 are real gaps (enforce router `allowed=None`, score route 404)
- Exact fixes needed documented in `memory/2026-02-19.md`
- Crypto bot: RUNNING (pid 92420, Cycle 50), PnL today $-10.54, 1 DOGEUSDT SHORT open, 0% win rate; Binance IP whitelist still needed (10.0.0.1 — Sid must fix)
- Full session log: memory/2026-02-19.md

### Critical API contracts (confirmed)
- `PolicyResult.decision` → `PolicyDecision` enum (allow/deny/stepup…), NOT `.allowed` bool
- `ReceiptsLedger.init/append/verify_chain` are ALL async — must use `asyncio.run()`
- `VersionControlStore(history_file=...)` not `db_path`
- `QuestionnaireEngine.questions` is a list property, not callable
- `RiskLevel` values are lowercase (`high` not `HIGH`)

### Continuation checkpoint (2026-02-19, 03:45 IST)
- All requested launch assets completed and committed (`df85922`): GTM package, sales stack, website package, self-score artifact, heartbeat/scoreboard updates.
- Validation confirmed: `run_full_validation.py` → 26 passed, 0 failed; stress-test hardening remains green from `3952480` (60/60).
- Operational check: crypto bot still running (`pid 92420`); latest cycle shows negative daily drift but no process failure.
