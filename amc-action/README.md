## Features

- **PR Comment** — Posts a formatted table with per-dimension scores. Updates existing comment on re-runs (no spam).
- **Score-Drop Detection** — Optionally compares HEAD vs base branch and fails if score regressed.
- **Badge** — Generates a shields.io badge in the step summary and as an artifact.
- **Artifacts** — Uploads `amc-result.json` and `amc-badge.md` for downstream consumption.
- **Configurable Gate** — Set `target-level` to enforce minimum maturity (e.g., L3 for production agents).

## Advanced: Use Outputs in Downstream Steps

```yaml
- uses: thewisecrab/AgentMaturityCompass/amc-action@main
  id: amc
  with:
    target-level: '2'

- run: echo "Score is ${{ steps.amc.outputs.score }} (${{ steps.amc.outputs.level }})"
```

## Advanced: Score-Drop Protection

```yaml
- uses: thewisecrab/AgentMaturityCompass/amc-action@main
  with:
    fail-on-drop: 'true'
    target-level: '3'
```
