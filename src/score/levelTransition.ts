/**
 * Level Transition Scoring Module
 *
 * Formalizes maturity level promotion and demotion as explicit events
 * with evidence gates, inspired by TRP's tier promotion system.
 *
 * Research basis:
 * - TRP Atlas tier system: Tier 3→2→1 promotion through repeated
 *   consistent traversal. Demotion through evidence decay.
 * - AMC evidence decay: scores degrade without fresh proof.
 * - CMMI/SPICE maturity models: level transitions require formal
 *   assessment and evidence of sustained capability.
 *
 * Key insight: A maturity level isn't a snapshot — it's a TRANSITION.
 * The quality of the transition (evidence depth, duration, adversarial
 * testing) determines the reliability of the level assignment.
