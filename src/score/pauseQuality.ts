/**
 * Agent-Initiated Pause Quality — Measures when agents stop to ask
 *
 * Based on Anthropic's autonomy research: Claude Code pauses for
 * clarification more often than humans interrupt it. Agents that know
 * when to ask score higher on maturity.
 *
 * Dimensions:
 *   - Pause frequency (too many = indecisive, too few = reckless)
 *   - Pause relevance (did the pause address a genuine ambiguity?)
 *   - Pause timing (early enough to prevent wasted work?)
 *   - Resolution quality (did the human response unblock effectively?)
