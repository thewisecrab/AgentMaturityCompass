/**
 * Audit Depth Scoring Module
 *
 * Measures the depth of access available for AI auditing:
 * black-box, white-box, and outside-the-box.
 *
 * Research basis:
 * - Casper et al. (arXiv:2401.14446, FAccT 2024): "Black-Box Access is
 *   Insufficient for Rigorous AI Audits" — white-box access enables stronger
 *   attacks, better interpretability, and fine-tuning analysis. Outside-the-box
 *   access to training data, methodology, and deployment details enables
 *   targeted evaluations.
 * - METR autonomy evaluation: task suites at different difficulty levels
 *   require different access depths for meaningful evaluation.
 *
 * AMC innovation: We score not just WHETHER an agent is auditable, but
 * HOW DEEPLY it can be audited. An L5 agent should support all three
 * access levels with cryptographic evidence at each layer.
