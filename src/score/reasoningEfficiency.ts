/**
 * Reasoning Efficiency Maturity
 * Scores whether an agent's reasoning is deep (effective) vs just long (verbose).
 * 
 * Inspired by: "Think Deep, Not Just Long" (Chen et al., 2026, arXiv:2602.13517)
 * Key insight: Token count has r=-0.59 correlation with accuracy. Deep-thinking
 * ratio (DTR) has r=0.683. Longer ≠ better. Agents that overthink degrade.
 *
 * Dimensions scored:
 * 1. Response selection/filtering — does the agent evaluate multiple candidates?
 * 2. Reasoning budget awareness — does the agent calibrate effort to task difficulty?
 * 3. Overthinking detection — does the agent detect and break verbose loops?
 * 4. Output length governance — are there caps/budgets on reasoning length?
 * 5. Accuracy-length monitoring — is the relationship between length and quality tracked?
 * 6. Early stopping capability — can the agent stop reasoning when confident?
 * 7. Reasoning trace audit — are reasoning traces logged for quality analysis?
