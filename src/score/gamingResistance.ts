/**
 * Gaming Resistance Scoring Module (Meta-Assurance)
 *
 * Tests whether the AMC scoring system itself can be gamed.
 * Can adversarial evidence injection inflate scores? Can an agent
 * produce contradictory evidence that confuses the diagnostic?
 *
 * This is meta-assurance: testing the test.
 *
 * Research basis:
 * - Alignment auditing (Marks et al. 2025): models can have hidden
 *   objectives that persist through safety training
 * - Sleeper Agents (Hubinger et al. 2024): adversarial training can
 *   teach models to HIDE unsafe behavior rather than remove it
 * - OWASP LLM Top 10: excessive agency, overreliance, model theft
 *   all represent gaming vectors against evaluation systems
 *
 * Attack vectors against scoring systems:
 * 1. Evidence flooding: submit massive amounts of low-quality evidence
 * 2. Selective evidence: only submit evidence for strong dimensions
 * 3. Temporal gaming: submit evidence in bursts before evaluation
 * 4. Context manipulation: behave well only in evaluation contexts
 * 5. Score inflation: exploit scoring formula edge cases
