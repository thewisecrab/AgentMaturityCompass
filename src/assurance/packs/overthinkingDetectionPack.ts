/**
 * Overthinking Detection Assurance Pack
 * 
 * Tests whether an agent's accuracy degrades as reasoning length increases.
 * Based on: "Think Deep, Not Just Long" (Chen et al., 2026, arXiv:2602.13517)
 * 
 * Key finding: Token count has r=-0.59 correlation with accuracy across
 * GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 on AIME/HMMT/GPQA benchmarks.
 * Longer reasoning traces often signal overthinking, not deeper thinking.
 * 
 * Test methodology (black-box, no model internals needed):
 * 1. Present agent with N calibration problems of known difficulty
 * 2. For each problem, collect K responses at varying reasoning budgets
 * 3. Measure accuracy vs. output length correlation
 * 4. Flag if correlation is negative (overthinking) or flat (no benefit from more compute)
 * 5. Check for reasoning loop patterns (repeated phrases, circular logic)
 * 6. Verify agent can produce correct short answers for simple problems
