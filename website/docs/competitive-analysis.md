## 4. Gap Analysis with Severity

### 🔴 CRITICAL Gaps (must close to compete)

| # | Gap | Who Has It | Impact | Effort |
|---|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| C1 | **No red teaming / security testing** | Promptfoo, Garak, CalypsoAI, Protect AI, DeepEval | AMC cannot address the #1 enterprise concern (AI security). Promptfoo's 50+ attack plugins make us look like we don't take security seriously. | HIGH |
| C2 | **No CI/CD integration** | Promptfoo, DeepEval, LangSmith | Developers can't run AMC assessments in their build pipeline. This is table stakes for developer adoption. | MEDIUM |
| C3 | **No production monitoring / observability** | LangSmith, Arize, Braintrust, AgentOps | AMC is point-in-time only. Can't detect drift, degradation, or attacks in production. Enterprise buyers expect continuous. | HIGH |
| C4 | **No LLM-as-judge evaluation metrics** | DeepEval (50+), Ragas, LangSmith | Modern eval uses LLM judges for nuanced quality assessment. AMC's test methodology doesn't include this approach. | MEDIUM |

### 🟠 HIGH Gaps (significant competitive disadvantage)

| # | Gap | Who Has It | Impact | Effort |
|---|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| H1 | **No regression testing** | DeepEval, Braintrust, Promptfoo | Can't show maturity improvement or degradation over time. Undercuts the "maturity journey" narrative. | MEDIUM |
| H2 | **Limited regulation coverage** (EU AI Act only) | Credo AI (EU AI Act, NIST, SOC 2, GDPR, HITRUST, ISO 42001) | Enterprise buyers in US need NIST AI RMF. Healthcare needs HITRUST. Everyone needs SOC 2. | MEDIUM |
| H3 | **No synthetic dataset generation** | DeepEval, Promptfoo, Ragas | Teams can't auto-generate test cases. Manual test creation doesn't scale. | MEDIUM |
| H4 | **No prompt injection / jailbreak testing** | Promptfoo (50+ types), Garak, CalypsoAI | The most visible AI security concern — and AMC has no specific tooling for it. | HIGH |
| H5 | **No agent tracing / execution visibility** | LangSmith, AgentOps, DeepEval | Can't see what agents actually did step-by-step. Gateway captures I/O but not internal reasoning. | HIGH |
| H6 | **No cloud/SaaS offering** | LangSmith, Arize, Braintrust, Credo AI | Enterprise teams want managed dashboards, not just CLI. | HIGH |

### 🟡 MEDIUM Gaps (nice-to-have, strengthen positioning)

| # | Gap | Who Has It | Impact | Effort |
|---|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| M1 | **No AI registry / shadow AI discovery** | Credo AI, Lasso | Can't help enterprises discover what AI they're running. | MEDIUM |
| M2 | **No model supply chain security** | Protect AI | No scanning of models before deployment. | HIGH |
| M3 | **No cost tracking / optimization** | LangSmith, AgentOps, MLflow | Token/cost visibility increasingly expected. | LOW |
| M4 | **No multi-language SDKs** | LangSmith (Py/TS/Go/Java), MLflow (Py/TS/Java/R) | Python-only limits enterprise adoption. | HIGH |
| M5 | **No SIEM/SOAR integration** | CalypsoAI | Security teams can't integrate AMC into existing SOC workflows. | MEDIUM |
| M6 | **No runtime defense / guardrails** | Lakera, CalypsoAI, Protect AI | AMC assesses but doesn't protect. Different market, but often bundled. | HIGH |
| M7 | **No time-travel debugging** | AgentOps | Replay agent runs for debugging — nice differentiator. | MEDIUM |

---

## 5. AMC's Unique Advantages (What Nobody Else Has)

These are our moats. No competitor replicates these:

### 🏆 Unmatched Advantages

| Advantage | Why It Matters | Nearest Competitor Gap |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Cryptographic Evidence Chains (Ed25519, Merkle trees)** | Tamper-proof audit trail. Essential for regulated industries. ZERO competitors have this. | Credo AI generates evidence but can't prove integrity cryptographically. |
| **L0-L5 Maturity Scoring** | Progression framework, not pass/fail. Shows journey. Maps to capability maturity (CMMI-style). | Everyone else does binary pass/fail or percentage scores. No maturity model. |
| **Evidence Trust Tiers (SELF_REPORTED 0.4x, OBSERVED 1.0x)** | Distinguishes between claimed and proven behavior. Unique epistemological approach to AI assessment. | Nobody else weights evidence by collection method. |
| **Deep diagnostic coverage + broad assurance library** | Deepest assessment library in the market by far. Orders of magnitude more than any competitor. | Promptfoo has ~50 vulnerability types. DeepEval has ~50 metrics. AMC goes far beyond point-in-time vuln checks. |
| **14 framework adapters** | Direct integration with actual agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.) for behavior capture. | Promptfoo connects to apps via API. Nobody adapts to the agent framework itself. |
| **Gateway behavioral capture** | Sits between agent and LLM, captures real behavior without agent cooperation. | LangSmith requires SDK integration. AMC gateway is transparent. |
| **Developer-first + governance depth** | CLI (481 commands) + REST API + Docker + Browser playground. Both developer and governance buyer. | Credo AI is enterprise-only. Promptfoo/DeepEval are dev-only. AMC bridges both. |

### Strategic Positioning Summary

AMC is the only tool that answers: **"How mature is this AI agent, and can you PROVE it?"**

- Promptfoo answers: "Is this AI app secure?"
- DeepEval answers: "Does this LLM output meet quality metrics?"
- LangSmith answers: "What is my agent doing in production?"
- Credo AI answers: "Is my AI compliant with regulations?"
- Garak answers: "Can this model be broken?"

**AMC uniquely combines assessment depth + evidence integrity + maturity progression + compliance mapping.** Nobody else does this.

## 6. Recommended Priorities for Closing Gaps

### Phase 1: Immediate (0-3 months) — Establish Credibility

| Priority | Action | Why Now |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **P1** | Add red teaming / security testing module | #1 enterprise concern. Without it, we're invisible to security buyers. Start with top 10 OWASP LLM vulnerabilities. |
| **P2** | Build CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) | Table stakes for developer adoption. Promptfoo and DeepEval win developers here. |
| **P3** | Add NIST AI RMF compliance mapping | US enterprise buyers need this alongside EU AI Act. Credo AI has it; we don't. |
| **P4** | Ship regression testing (compare assessments over time) | Core to the "maturity journey" value prop. Without it, maturity scoring is a one-time snapshot. |

### Phase 2: Near-term (3-6 months) — Competitive Parity

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **P5** | Add LLM-as-judge evaluation metrics | Modern evaluation standard. DeepEval's 50+ metrics set expectations. |
| **P6** | Build production monitoring (continuous assessment) | Move from point-in-time to continuous. Bridge to observability. |
| **P7** | Add synthetic test generation | Auto-generate test cases for coverage. Reduces manual effort. |
| **P8** | Add SOC 2 + GDPR compliance packs | Enterprise deal requirements. Credo AI has these out of the box. |

### Phase 3: Medium-term (6-12 months) — Market Leadership

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **P9** | Launch cloud/SaaS dashboard | Enterprise teams need managed experience, not just CLI. |
| **P10** | Build agent tracing integration | Show what agents do internally, not just I/O. |
| **P11** | Add ISO 42001 + HITRUST compliance packs | Complete the regulation coverage. |
| **P12** | Multi-language SDK (TypeScript at minimum) | Expand beyond Python developers. |

### Phase 4: Long-term (12+ months) — Category Definition

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **P13** | AI Registry / Shadow AI discovery | Enterprise governance buyers need inventory. |
| **P14** | Runtime guardrails (optional module) | "Assess AND protect" bundle. |
| **P15** | SIEM/SOAR integration | Enterprise SOC integration. |

## 8. Competitive Positioning Recommendations

### Tagline Evolution
- **Current implied:** "Assess AI agent maturity"  
- **Recommended:** "Prove AI agent maturity — with cryptographic evidence"

### Differentiation Narrative
> "Other tools tell you if your AI is working. AMC proves it — with cryptographic evidence chains that auditors and regulators can verify independently. We don't just test; we provide a maturity roadmap from L0 to L5 with tamper-proof evidence at every step."

### Target Buyer Mapping

| Buyer | Their Pain | AMC's Answer | Primary Competitor |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **CISO** | "Is our AI secure?" | Security assurance packs + evidence chains | Promptfoo, CalypsoAI |
| **Head of AI/ML** | "Are our agents production-ready?" | L0-L5 maturity scoring + framework adapters | DeepEval, LangSmith |
| **Compliance Officer** | "Can we prove EU AI Act compliance?" | Compliance mapping + cryptographic evidence | Credo AI |
| **VP Engineering** | "How do we test agents in CI?" | CLI + CI/CD integration + regression testing | Promptfoo, DeepEval |
| **Auditor** | "Can I trust this assessment?" | Ed25519 signatures + Merkle trees + trust tiers | NOBODY (unique) |
